# POSTGRESQL-SALES-ANALYSIS
# Pizza Sales Data Analysis
This repository showcases the end-to-end analysis of pizza sales data, covering data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, and Power BI.

# Project Overview
## Data Cleaning  
- Cleaned raw pizza sales data using Microsoft Excel to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency in the dataset.
## Data Analysis 
- Utilized PostgreSQL for:
Writing SQL queries to calculate key metrics like total sales, monthly trends, and category-wise sales.
Performing advanced operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregations.
## Data Visualization
- Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize:
Monthly sales trends.
Sales distribution by pizza categories.
Insights into top-performing items and sales performance.
# Key Files
- Pizza_Sales_Cleaning.xlsx: Contains the cleaned and pre-processed dataset.
- Pizza_Sales_Queries.sql: Includes all SQL queries used for analysis and calculations.
- Pizza_Sales_Dashboard.pdf: A Power BI dashboard exported as a PDF for visualization.
# Key Insights
- Identified high-performing pizza categories and monthly trends in sales.
- Highlighted sales opportunities through data visualization.
# Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and initial exploration.
- PostgreSQL: Data analysis and calculations.
- Power BI: Data visualization and reporting.
# How to Use
- Explore the Excel file to understand the cleaning steps applied.
- Review the SQL queries for analysis logic.
- View the PDF dashboard for visual insights.

## 1.	Total Sales: Sum of total_sale.
```POSTGRESQL
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total_sale)::numeric, 4) AS "Total Sales"
FROM pizza_sales;
This displayed the total sale of pizza to be 817860.0500


## 2.	Total Orders: Count of unique order_id.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS "Total Order"
FROM pizza_sales;
This displades the total order to be  21350.


## 3.	Average Order Value (AOV): Total Sales รท Total Orders.
SELECT SUM(total_sale) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS "Average Order Value"
FROM pizza_sales;

Average order value is 38.307262295081635.

SELECT SUM(quantity) AS "Total Quantity Sold"
FROM pizza_sales;

Total quantity order is 49574.

##  5.	Total Qunatity Sold by Pizza Size.
SELECT pizza_size, SUM(total_sale) AS "Total Sales"
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY "Total Sales" DESC;

##  9. Total Quantity Ordered by Month.
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS Month, SUM(quantity) AS "Total quantity Ordered"
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY "Total quantity Ordered" DESC;

The number in the first column is the Month number while the second column contain the total pizza order. You can check the SQL file for more details  (We have Month of July as the best Month of order with 4392 ordered).

##  10. Total Quantity Ordered by Day and Month.
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM order_date) AS Day,EXTRACT (MONTH FROM order_date) AS Month, SUM(quantity) AS "Total quantity Ordered"
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY Day, Month
ORDER BY "Total quantity Ordered" DESC;

The code display the quantity order by day and month
day Month quantity order
